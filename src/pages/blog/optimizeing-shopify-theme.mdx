## Some tips and recommendations for optimizing and boosting performance of an old Shopify theme.

At <a href="https://acromatico.dev" target="_blank">Acrom√°tico Development</a>
we are allways helping our clients optimize their Shopify stores, not only the
UX and UI, but also the performance and speed of the site. Optimizing a Shopify
theme is not a simple task, it has been a long learning path that continues
evolving and improving as we test and try new methodologies.

In this first blog post I want to share some of the things I've learned during
this process, that way maybe I can help other jump through some of the hard
parts of successfully optimizing a Shopify theme.

### Initial Analysis

Let's start by (in a really broad sense) diferenciating the optimizations that
can be done on a Site. We started by separating them in two main areas:

1. **Optimizing the Server:** Changes that have to do with where you are hosting
   the page, things like having a fast and reliable CDN, having all the correct
   catching policies, how fast the server responds, how near to the end user the
   server is located, etc. This part is nearly imposible to optimize for a
   Shopify theme since all this part is controlled by Shopify itself.
2. **Optimizing the Code:** Changes that have to be done on the code of the
   theme, here's where most of our efforts will be focused. Things like
   preconnecting to 3rd party servers, preloading assets, removing unused code,
   optimizing images and orchestating CSS and JavaScript loading times are the
   things we are going to focus on this section.

### Optimizing the Code

I know there are many ways to aproach the optimization the differents parts of
the code, but this is the process I follow, hope that it makes sense for the
mayority of the cases. For this example I will use one of our client's themes
(we have previus authorisation to use this theme as an example), the store is
calles <a href="https://lycklig.com.mx" target="_blank">Lycklig Party Shop</a> and they sell party supplies. They have been in
Shopify since 2016 and the theme has been the same sinse the start of the store.

#### Preconnecting to 3rd party servers and preloading known assets
