## Some tips and recommendations for optimizing and boosting performance of an old Shopify theme.

At <a href="https://acromatico.dev" target="_blank">AcromÃ¡tico Development</a>
we are always helping our clients optimize their Shopify stores, not only the UX
and UI, but also the performance and speed of the site. Optimizing a Shopify
theme is not a simple task, it has been a long learning path that continues
evolving and improving as we test and try new methodologies.

This is a continuation of the Optimizing an old Shopify Theme series, if you
want to read about the initial analysis done to know what to look for in a
theme, check out the [part 1](/blog/optimizeing-shopify-theme-1) of this series.

#### Preconnecting to 3rd party servers and preloading known assets

One of the easiest and most effective things to do when optimizing a Shopify
theme is to make sure that the site has the basic servers preconnected and ready
to be used by the files and assests that will be downloaded.

Using the experiments tab on the WebPage test app we found out the next servers
could be preconnected:

- fonts.gstatic.com
- cdn.shopify.com
- fonts.shopifycdn.com

As well we found out there were 2 filles that could be preloaded:

```text
- https://a.klaviyo.com/media/js/onsite/onsite.js
- https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.3/jquery.min.js (Yes, this site still uses JQuery)
- https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:700
- https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400
```

We added the next lines to the head of the theme:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.shopify.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.shopifycdn.com" />
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="https://a.klaviyo.com/media/js/onsite/onsite.js"
  as="script"
/>
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.3/jquery.min.js"
  as="script"
/>
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:700"
  as="style"
/>
<link
  rel="preload"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400"
  as="style"
/>
```

#### Removing unused and slow scripts

This next step is super easy and can help a lot when optimizing a Shopify theme.
Normally a merchant will install apps or manually add code for certain
functionality they needed. If it is an old theme it is super easy to forget you
installed apps or added code that you are not longer using. In the best scenario
it will be code that gets downloaded and slows down the site, in the worst
scenario, it will generate errors.

By going to the console and the network tab we filter the JS Files and order
them by total time to load we can see the next result:

<div class="image__container">
  <img
    alt="Lycklig JS Download"
    style="aspect-ratio: 4/3;"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acromatico-development/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_300/v1661395344/Rafa%20Blog/lycklig-js-download_siplp5.png"

            https://res.cloudinary.com/acromatico-development/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_968/v1661395344/Rafa%20Blog/lycklig-js-download_siplp5.png 968w"
    sizes="(max-width: 310px) 300px,
          (max-width: 510px) 500px,
          (max-width: 768px) 760px,
          (max-width: 1024px) 500px,
          968px"
  />
  <small>Lycklig JS Downloaded by Theme</small>
</div>

There are 5 super slow scripts:

```text
- https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/shopify/assets/shop_events_listener-65cd0ba3fcd81a1df33f2510ec5bcf8c0e0958653b50e3965ec972dd638ee13f.js
- https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1866/3075/t/8/assets/modernizr.min.js?v=21391054748206432451628529599
- ttps://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/boomerang/shopify-boomerang-1.0.0.min.js
- https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1866/3075/t/8/assets/theme.js?v=95155629628367876391628529613
- https://cdn.shopify.com/s/trekkie.storefront.ebdc6f6e0c97d8f5d6a7dac9bc6ab298fff7cf1b.min.js
```

All of themm are essential scripts with the exception of modernizr. Lets go
ahead and remove modernizr file from the `theam.liquid` file and check that
there are no errors.

We got an error in the `theme.js` file. Lets see if we can fix it by removing
any reference to modernizr.

<div class="image__container">
  <img
    alt="Lycklig Modernizr Error"
    style="aspect-ratio: 22/5;"
    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/acromatico-development/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,w_300/v1661395373/Rafa%20Blog/lycklig-modernizr_mcanhk.png"

    sizes="(max-width: 310px) 300px,
          (max-width: 510px) 500px,
          (max-width: 768px) 760px,
          (max-width: 1024px) 500px,
          968px"
  />

</div>

We found a `Modernizr` instance being referenced in diferent parts of the file.
We just carefully deleted them and the error was gone. The problem was that all
the icons of the theme changed to text ðŸ‘Ž. This has become a larger prioblem so
we will go back to not removing the modernizr file.

#### Images Optimization and Elements with Layout Shifts

By looking at the
[Web Vitals Webpage Test Report](https://www.webpagetest.org/vitals.php?test=220819_BiDc6R_B5K&run=3#cls)
we can see diferent elements that produce layout shifts. The main one is the
announcement bar. Lets add a fix height to the announcement bar to fix that
issue.

As well the main logo appears from no where and moves the size of the header. We
can add an aspect ratio property to the logo to fix that by adding
`aspect-ratio: 10/3;` to the logo style tag.

Something we noted in the code was that all the images of the theme have lazy
loading added, even the initially rendered ones. We removed all the lazuy
loading added to the initial images. as well we added a `srcset` attribute and a
`sizes` attribute to the images and even some images where still rendered with
the CSS `background-image` property, we changed that to be an `img` tag.

This is the code to render the images of the slider before the changes:

```html
<style>
  @media screen and (max-width: 1024px) and (max-height: 768px)  {
    .hero__image--{{ block.id }} {
      background-image: url('{{ block.settings.image | img_url: '1024x1024' | format: 'jpg' }}');
    }
  }
  @media screen and (min-width: 1025px), screen and (min-height: 769px) {
    .hero__image--{{ block.id }} {
      background-image: url('{{ block.settings.image | img_url: '2048x2048' | format: 'jpg' }}');
    }
  }
</style>

<div
  class="hero__image hero__image--{{ block.id }}"
  data-image="{{ block.settings.image | img_url: '1024x1024' | format: 'jpg' }}"
></div>
```

After we changed the code it looked like this:

```html
<div class="hero__image hero__image--{{ block.id }}">
  <img
    srcset="{{ block.settings.image | img_url: '320x320' }} 320w,
                {{ block.settings.image | img_url: '480x480' }} 480w,
                {{ block.settings.image | img_url: '800x800' }} 800w,
                {{ block.settings.image | img_url: '1024x1024' }} 1024w,
                {{ block.settings.image | img_url: '2048x2048' }} 2048w"
    sizes="(max-width: 320px) 320px,
              (max-width: 480px) 480px,
              (max-width: 800px) 800px,
              (max-width: 1024px) 1024px,
              2048px"
    src="{{ block.settings.image | img_url: '2048x2048' }}"
    loading="lazy"
    width="2048"
    height="2048"
    alt="{{ block.settings.image.alt | escape }}"
    class=""
  />
</div>
```

### The Final Results

Over all we think the theme was all ready well optimized, changes where minor
and the most relevant change had to do with the slider images. There are other
areas of improvement like removing modernizr and jquery from the base libraries
the theme uses but that is considered a huge change in which case it would be
better to consider migrating to a newer theme.

The final reports made in Web Page Test ands Google Page Speed Insights are
available here:

Hope this entry helps you optimizing your Shopify Themes, this same concept can
be applied to any web page with the difference of the usage of liquid and maybe
having more control over the scripts that are being loaded in the page.
